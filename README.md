# Skylanders Cryptographic Programming Project

## Overview
This project is a personal endeavor aimed at learning and practicing cryptographic programming using the Rust programming language. The focus of this project is to explore encryption and decryption techniques in a hands-on manner by reverse-engineering game data from the Skylanders series.
